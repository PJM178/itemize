TODO TECH

Implement flagging

- Implement some form of triggers, maybe callback functions in the resolvers, we should have some form of user trigger to remove e_validated and
  whatnot

Add canCreateInBehalf functionality, this functionality can have roles and stuff, it does not much other
than create a component with a different owner id

Add owner based searches as so, where SELF is allowed for checking up









Add parents, should work as

canBeParented   boolean
mustBeParented  boolean
canOnlyBeParentedBy {
    module: path/path/path,
    itemDefinition: path/path/path,
}

Searches should have then

parented_by     qualifiedPathName

parented by searches should be able to be updated or something and have some sort
of listener for parented searches
