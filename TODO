SEO
1. SSR Implementation via constructor and SSR rules, SSR rules will be rules specific to an url
  0. Only public data, user specific data can be loaded client side
  1. TOKEN, ID, ROLE, LANG, etc... all localstorage data is sent via cookie to create a fakeStorage where info can be fetch
  2. Routes must have their own SSR rules, these SSR rules allow to set the variable global.DATA that acts as endpoint
  for initial fetching for data hydration, somehow this data must be accessible as well on the server side, where lifecycles
  do not get hit
  3. SSR rules will have their own way to set the title as well as description and other SEO tags
  4. SlowLoadingComponent must be immediate and be immediately ready on server contexts
  5. manifest and html set via the SSR rules

TECH
. Revamp currency to have a normalized_value in dollars
. Revamp currency search to use normalized_value on mismatch or the value on match
. Maybe download a list of base conversions from https://free.currencyconverterapi.com/ automatically every day
. Currencies ["EEK", "LTL", "GWP"] not supported in API all others supported, these currencies are not in the country list
so can safely be removed

. Image support in rich text
