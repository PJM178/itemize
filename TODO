SITE

TECH

- Add a script called pgdump.sh and pgload.sh which calls pg_dump and creates a tar of the entire database as a backup
this should exist in the deployment
- Modify the way the search works, using last_modified rather than created_at as the exposed property and use the deleted
list in order to change everything in how realtime updates work, both in the cache worker and the traditional search
- Improve the way the security is managed in the schema, somehow we need to be able to make the metaroles work simply
