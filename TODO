SEO (LOWEST PRIORITY)
1. SSR Implementation via constructor and SSR rules, SSR rules will be rules specific to an url
  0. Only public data, user specific data can be loaded client side
  1. TOKEN, ID, ROLE, LANG, etc... all localstorage data is sent via cookie to create a fakeStorage where info can be fetch
  2. Routes must have their own SSR rules, these SSR rules allow to set the variable global.DATA that acts as endpoint
  for initial fetching for data hydration, somehow this data must be accessible as well on the server side, where lifecycles
  do not get hit
  3. SSR rules will have their own way to set the title as well as description and other SEO tags
  4. SlowLoadingComponent must be immediate and be immediately ready on server contexts
  5. manifest and html set via the SSR rules
  6. SSR rules should be able to load resources as well
