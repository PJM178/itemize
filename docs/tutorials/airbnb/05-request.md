# Request

Now we need to have a way to make booking requests on the properties that we have added, and these requests will need to be approved, denied or ignored.

We want to send an email notification to the host when this occurs and to the requested as well when they have received a positive or negative answer.

## Creating the request schema

## Building the reservation request page

## Securing the status of the request

## Sending email notifications

## Ensuring non-overlapping requests and responses

## Displaying overlaps in the client side
