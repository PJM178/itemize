â€¢ **default**: `GraphQLObjectType`<`any`, `any`, { [key: string]: `any`;  }\>

This standard reply is pretty meaningless for the user it is basically
just a messsage that should aid the developer on how it succeeded
in order to give errors you should use

throw new EndpointError({
  message: "whatever",
  code: ENDPOINT_ERRORS.UNSPECIFIED,
});

The standard reply exists because graphql needs something for success
