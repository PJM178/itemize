TODO TECH

- Remove rarity, and searchMode replace it with canSearch
- Implement some form of triggers, maybe callback functions in the resolvers, we should have some form of user trigger to remove e_validated and
  whatnot

- Idea for the special cache, websockets pub sub, websockets would make a connection and pub sub by a string
{register: [type, id]}
server will websocket reply with
{register: [type, id, date]}
unregister with
{unregister: [type, id]}

server will send the following message on an event
{event: [type, id, uuid]}

the uuid now has to be part of the basic mutations and token and everything

polling should be a fallback for the websocket using socket.io should suffice, this will allow the
cache to be efficient

service worker will also do the caching by checking the request, and checking for a larger payload
probably a requestFields, queryName, header must be added for the service worker to manage
service worker returns if it finds a match
if disableCache header is present, then service worker does not use cache and cache the new result
the websocket will tell with the date that it returns if the dates match and then the loadValue can run again
with the new information
service worker cache must be flushed during logouts

- Implement service workers
