TODO TECH

- Implement unique index in SQL
- Implement unique type in property type as a configuration
- Implement type checks, the invalid will be given depending on whether one is on the server or client side, maybe add a PropertyDefinition.checkUniqueIndex function
  that would use fetch in the client side and a sql query on the server side and whatnot, or nothing, it will crash the query
  on create or edit so it is yet safe, just check if fetch is available to do the request for a valid index
- Implement some form of triggers, maybe callback functions in the resolvers, we should have some form of user trigger to remove e_validated and
  whatnot




- Implement service workers
