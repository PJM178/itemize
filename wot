TODO TECH

- Remove rarity, and searchMode replace it with canSearch
- Implement some form of triggers, maybe callback functions in the resolvers, we should have some form of user trigger to remove e_validated and
  whatnot

add a canCreateInBehalf ability to items, to items can be created in regards of someone else
search function should be able to specify an owner id for requests, optional; for any request
in the server side during search specifying an owner id should change how the request works, SELF rules should apply
if it matches
search function should be able to specify an owner id as the current user id for requests
search function should be able to register a trigger to the remote listener of when new things are added
to the specific owner id, (maybe pass a token) the server will trigger a search-updated or something event
with an ID_CONTAINER
we need a count function as well (can be added later)

The functionality above will allow messaging between users, by creating an item where only the owner
has read access, allowing other users to create in behalf of that user, and the user will then get an
event if there's an active search with that userid

these kind of searchs might be cached?...naaaaah

- Implement service workers
