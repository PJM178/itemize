TODO TECH

0. Restructure conditional rule set for getting the value of the property directly without checking for whether is valid or not as
right now it uses getCurrentValue which does the check, this is pointless
1. Support properties as value in conditional rule set, so it can use a property value for checking the condition just like
property maps can do
2. create an invalidIf condition which does take an object with conditions, just like enforcedValues, and takes an user defined
error code, FROM_LARGER_THAN_TO and TO_SMALLER_THAN_FROM will be reserved, and added to invalid conditions, which are reserved, we
will need checkers for that, translation strings will be needed.
