// Remember that when adding fast prototyping components they might demand

// Uncaught Error: Unknown key in context: xxxxxxx from localization.tsx
// this means this is a required localization key you need to go to your
// schema .properties file, depending on the context, and add the missing key
// keys are self descriptive on what they should contain, it might be data for
// hard hearing, tooltips or just display text

// you need to run npm run build-data to rebuild language packs if you are
// in development mode with the service worker set up as `bypass for network`
// it should work out of the box after a refresh
